# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.

      I'm am planning to use a regular, single array, but may switch to embedded arrays if necessary.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

    My plan is to use divs to represent each square on the board and then wrap them in a larger board div. I further plan to use for loops, if statements and callbacks to determine which symbol goes in which squares, when player x is allowed to go vs player o and also when game play is finished.

-   How you plan to approach this project.

    I have started by laying out the sections of my html, then divided each section into areas of user interaction, then further detailed those sections until I had a working checklist of coding tasks. I also plan to reference provided documentation, ask consultants/fellow devs for assistance and test various aspects of my project as it progresses. I am also assigning specific blocks of time to each checklist task.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    * As a player, I want to be able to compete against other people during games.
    * As a player, I want to have my record of wins and losses saved, so I can view them when I am signed in.
    * As a player, I want to have a unique account that only I can access and edit.
    * As a player, I want to be informed about game play throughout each game.


-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

    My plan is to follow the examples set forth in class. I also plan to make changes to any examples based on what makes sense for my project. So far, I'm planning to have:
      * html
      * css
      * script
        * sign in
        * sign out
        * sign up
        * change password
      * game board
        * win
        * cat
        * reset


-   What creative spin will you add to your project?

    My main goal is to meet all of the assignment requirements. If I find I have extra time, I will probably devote it to the ux aspect of the project.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

    I plan to use different branches, to test and commit my code often and to push my code up to github to make sure that my work is backed up.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

    Probably not, my plan is to focus on meeting the requirements to the best of my abilities and I don't imagine I'll have any spare time to devote to the bonuses.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
